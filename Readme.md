## ClearCache

ClearCache is a simple Google Chrome extension that clears the cache/browsing data in one-click. This was a way for me to learn how to create a Chrome extension and work with the api. 


## Motivation

As of Nov. 2016, I had problems with Chrome 54 and it's inconsistent cache refreshing (CTRL + F5). It would force me to go to Settings > Advanced > Clear Browsing Data. It was too many clicks for me so I wrote this extension to skip those extra clicks. :) Sure, there are plenty of extensions that do the same thing, but I wanted to learn the Chrome Extensions API and build something from scratch.

## Installation

1. Grab these files and place them into a folder
2. In Chrome, click on Settings and click on Extensions
3. Check the box for Developer Mode
4. Click Load unpacked extension...
5. Navigate to the folder with the extension files inside
6. Click Ok - you will see the extension's icon to the right of the Address bar
